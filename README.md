# Group-Formation-of-Multi-Agent-Systems

A project for a 2nd year deign course using MATLAB to simulate the Group Formation of a Multi Agent System.

Specifically, the MATLAB App uses Lloyd's Algorithm to simulate how robotic bees would distribute over an area to pollinate unpollinated plants/flowers.
